    "#The main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric in KNN is the way they calculate the distance between data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "#1 - Euclidean distance: It is calculated as the straight-line distance between two points in a Euclidean space. In a 2-dimensional space, the Euclidean distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the formula: sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2). It considers the magnitude of the differences between coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2 - Manhattan distance: It is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between the coordinates of two points. In a 2-dimensional space, the Manhattan distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the formula: |x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1|. It measures the distance along the grid lines, similar to navigating through a city block.\n",
    "\n",
    "#The choice of distance metric can affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor. Euclidean distance tends to give more importance to differences in magnitude, while Manhattan distance focuses on the differences in individual dimensions. This means that the choice of distance metric can influence the way KNN calculates similarity between data points. If the data features have different scales or there are outliers, the Euclidean distance may be sensitive to these factors. In such cases, the Manhattan distance may provide a more robust measure of similarity. However, the optimal choice of distance metric depends on the specific dataset and problem at hand, and it is recommended to experiment with both metrics to determine which one performs better."
